<h1>Started Various Bands & Music Projects</h1>

<p>
  I was in several bands growing up and learned several different instruments and styles of composition. I wrote several different songs and was everything from promoter, apparel creator & designer, web guy, band manager, front man & lead singer, guitarist, keyboardist, and goofball. Styles included relaxing acoustic music, post-hardcore, rock/punk, alternative, and more recently, electronica & dubstep. One band I was in (Blind Ambition) was involved in a lawsuit at my high school and another (Teolyn) got offered a contract, recording deal, and national tour.
