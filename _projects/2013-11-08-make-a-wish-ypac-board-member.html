<p>Make-A-Wish grants the wishes of a children with life-threatening medical conditions to enrich the human experience with hope, strength & joy. As one of the first YPAC board members upon it's founding in 2011, I learned an incredible amount about how Make-A-Wish works, how non-profits can powerfully raise money, network, and change lives. I also had the opportunity to be a wish granter where I would meet with a wish child and their family, listen to their wish and work within the organization to make it come true.<br />
