<p>At 22 years old I was responsible for the multi million dollar project of designing, building, opening, and running Service Spring's California manufacturing & distribution facility. I spent about a year and a half of my life living, breathing, and working on every aspect imaginable of this project until it was completed, under budget and on time with a happy crew. I learned so much about myself and business and that I can function of of barely any sleep!<br />
