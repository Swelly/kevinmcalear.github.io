<p>I was on an amazing team (that I even got to lead for a season) that were the "think tank" for our entire organization. We got to do tons of R&amp;D, build prototypes, ask tough and crazy questions and then answer them, improve our process and equipment, and we even got to invent brand new ways to make and do things! I was a part of a team of four people that revolutionized several ways of doing things and birthing new equipment from our brains to the shop floors to do it.</p>
