<p>I was tasked with researching and building out an idea to sell a unique digital educational/training product in the garage door industry called Solutions Education. Solutions Education is a series of training videos created by industry experts to educate professional garage door technicians and standardize your training process. It provides a platform for a company to take video-based courses we made, take a tests on them we administer digitally, and get certified on different skill sets. Everyone gets their own profile, and every company can administer their employee's information. This was a fun product to help create and to watch grow!</p>
