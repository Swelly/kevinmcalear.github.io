  Kinvolved is an app to improve PreK-12 student attendance by sharing real-time information among families, schools, and after-school programs. I was the third employee and responsible for all tech aspects of the company as well as actually building the application. You may have seen Kinvolved in things such as <a href="http://www.forbes.com/30under30/#/education" target="_blank">Forbes 30 Under 30</a>, <a href="http://video.foxnews.com/v/3911176190001/kinvolved-app-aims-to-improve-school-attendance/?#sp=show-clips" target="_blank">FOX News</a>, <a href="http://www.marketplace.org/topics/education/learningcurve/student-data-and-school-attendance" target="_blank">NPR's Marketplace</a>, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/kinvolveds-solution-to-kids-skipping-school-2014-4" target="_blank">Business Insider</a>, <a href="http://www.ny1.com/archives/nyc/all-boroughs/2014/09/27/app-wrap---kinvolved--NYC_216253.old.html" target="_blank">NY1</a>, <a href="http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140924/west-harlem/attendance-tracking-app-expands-16-west-harlem-schools" target="_blank">DNAInfo</a>, and many more.
