<p>
  Using publicly-available attendance and school performance data from the <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/Accountability/tools/report/default.htm#FindPR" target="_blank">NYC Department of Education</a>, I created a tool to explore the correlations among zip codes, attendance, and graduation rates in NYC. It was also used in Kinvolved's presentation at <a href="https://vimeo.com/113464553" target="_blank">NY Tech Meetup</a> (around 1:14:30) and I also gave a talk at <a href="http://nyc.civicdesigncamp.org/" target="_blank">Civic Design Camp</a> using this tool.
