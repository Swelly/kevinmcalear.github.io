<p>
  Outdoola is an online marketplace for hunting, fishing, and other outdoor adventures. I designed and built the web application and co-founded the company with two other people while all of us were in three different cities. (Brooklyn, NY,  Atlanta, GA, and Space Coast, FL) We learned a lot about taking an idea and building it into a product on the side. We also applied to Y Combinator and got rejected but learned a lot from the experience.
