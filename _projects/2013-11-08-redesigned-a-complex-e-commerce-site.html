<p>Service Spring Corporation has always been the innovator regarding technology in their industry. They built their old e-commerce website from scratch using modern web technology at the time. But, as technology goes, it was time for a complete infrastructure overhaul. So, I led a team to research & develop the best new site with the future in mind and we did just that! It was a great project to apply modern HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP, responsive design, CMS, UX, & other best practices to build a quality site that will grow into the future!<br />
