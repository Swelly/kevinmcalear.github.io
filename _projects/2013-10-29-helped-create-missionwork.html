<p>
  Mission At Work is a uniquely Service Spring answer to the problem of connecting people who want to volunteer and the organizations that desperately need these volunteers. We wanted to come up with a way to give back some of the blessings and use as many of our collective resources as possible. Mission@Work has given lots of time, money, resources, and love to several non-profits in the area and has help bond Service Spring Employees together through service.
