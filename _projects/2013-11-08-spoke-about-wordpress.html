  I was asked to explain what the heck <a href="http://wordpress.org" title="WordPress" target="_blank">WordPress</a> is, why it can be valuable, what else is out there, and to walk through building a WordPress site from scratch. So, I asked my brother, <a href="http://mattmcalear.net" title="Matt McAlear" target="_blank">Matt McAlear</a> to help with the talk and together we explained everything we were asked to do in a fun way. We even showed how you could build a fantastic site from "scratch" in less than 10 minutes. Because we are nerds.
