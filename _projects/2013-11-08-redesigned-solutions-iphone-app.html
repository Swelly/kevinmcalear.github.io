<p>
  I built out a new user interface and user experience, updating the application to an iOS7 look and feel (incorporating flat design when appropriate for example). I worked with our internal iOS developer and provided him with extremely organized and customizable Photoshop files organized into easy-to-use groupings for individual items.
